# guitar-keyboard
Arduino (Pro Micro) code that let's you type by playing guitar (into a Microphone on pin A0). 

Uses FFT to detect notes and Arduino Keyboard Library to send keystrokes via USB.
Very roughly inspired by [abhilash_patel](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/abhilashpatel121/arduino-music-notes-and-chord-detector-728b14).

# Libraries
[arduinoFFT](https://github.com/kosme/arduinoFFT), [Keyboard](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/usb/keyboard/), [KickMath](https://github.com/LinnesLab/KickMath).
